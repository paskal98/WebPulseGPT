Project Overview: To-Do App
1. Project Setup
Initialize a new Node.js project with npm init.
Install necessary Node.js packages like express for your server and mongoose for interacting with MongoDB.
Set up a MongoDB database, either locally or using a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.
2. Front-End Development (HTML, CSS, JS)
Design a simple and intuitive user interface using HTML and CSS.
Use JavaScript for dynamic interactions on the client side, like adding, completing, or removing tasks.
3. Back-End Development (Node.js, Express)
Create a RESTful API using Express. This API will handle requests like retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting tasks.
Ensure your API communicates with the MongoDB database to store and retrieve tasks.
4. Database Integration (MongoDB)
Design your MongoDB schema for the to-do tasks. Typically, this includes fields like task name, status, priority, and timestamps.
Use Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, to interact with the database.
5. Features to Include
Add Tasks: Users should be able to add new tasks to their to-do list.
View Tasks: Display a list of tasks. You might include filters or sorting (by date, completed status, priority).
Mark as Complete: Users can mark tasks as complete or toggle them back to incomplete.
Delete Tasks: Allow users to delete tasks from the list.
Edit Tasks: Implement functionality to edit the details of a task.
User Authentication: Allow users to create accounts and save their to-do lists.
Due Dates and Reminders: Users can set due dates for tasks and receive reminders.
Prioritization: Ability to prioritize tasks, possibly using different colors or sorting.
Responsive Design: Ensure the app is usable on various devices and screen sizes.
Data Persistence: Tasks should be stored in the MongoDB database to persist between sessions.
