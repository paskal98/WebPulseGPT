B1: Hi, to start with new project please write me project name
B2: Please, describe me more how it should work. Make list of functions and their specific task. Add style and additional information if needed
Q1: Do you wanna add something else in you project?
Q2: When you think step by step through all user stories and tasks that you listed, is there anything unclear that you need to ask the client before you can create an initial version of the application? Keep in mind that we're not building here the fully featured app but rather an MVP so not all needs to be perfect.
