Project Overview: Web-Based Snake Game (Client-Side)

1. Project Setup
Begin with setting up a basic web project structure: create files for HTML (for the game's structure), CSS (for styling), and JavaScript (for game logic).
Use a code editor like Visual Studio Code for development, ensuring that the project is well-organized and easily maintainable.
Optionally, utilize a simple HTTP server for local testing, though this game can be run directly from a file due to its client-side nature.

2. Front-End Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
HTML: Design the game's layout with a focus on simplicity, incorporating elements such as the game canvas and optional UI elements like score displays or game control buttons.
CSS: Use CSS to style the game's interface, ensuring it is responsive and visually appealing. Consider mobile and desktop users by implementing a flexible layout.
JavaScript: Implement the game's core logic, including snake movement, food placement, collision detection, score management, and game state (start, pause, game over). Use the Canvas API for rendering the game elements.

3. Features to Include
Game Mechanics: Basic gameplay functionalities including controlling the snake's direction, growing with food consumption, and handling collisions with the game area's boundaries or the snake itself.
Scoring System: Implement a scoring system that increases with each piece of food the snake consumes. Display the score to the user in real-time.
Game Controls: Allow players to control the snake using keyboard arrow keys or on-screen controls for touch devices.
High Score Tracking: Utilize the browser's localStorage to store and retrieve high scores, enabling players to see their best performances across sessions.
Game Levels: Increase difficulty as the game progresses, such as by speeding up the snake or introducing new obstacles, to keep the game challenging and engaging.
Responsive Design: Ensure that the game is playable on a wide range of devices and screen sizes by using responsive design techniques.
