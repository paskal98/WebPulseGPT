Project Overview: Calendar App
1. Project Setup
Initialize a new Node.js project with npm init.
Install Node.js packages necessary for the project such as express for the server and mongoose for interacting with MongoDB.
Set up a MongoDB database, either locally or using a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas, to store calendar events.
2. Front-End Development (HTML, CSS, JS)
Design a user interface that's simple and intuitive, using HTML and CSS, for displaying a calendar view (monthly, weekly, daily).
Use JavaScript for dynamic interactions on the client side, such as adding, editing, or removing calendar events, and switching between calendar views.
3. Back-End Development (Node.js, Express)
Create a RESTful API using Express to handle requests like retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting calendar events.
Ensure API communication with the MongoDB database to store and retrieve calendar events.
4. Database Integration (MongoDB)
Design your MongoDB schema for calendar events, including fields like event title, description, start time, end time, and attendees.
Use Mongoose to interact with the database, leveraging its capabilities to manage event data effectively.
5. Features to Include
Add Events: Users should be able to add new events to their calendar.
View Events: Display events in daily, weekly, or monthly views. Include filters for searching or sorting events.
Edit Events: Allow users to modify details of events.
Delete Events: Enable event removal from the calendar.
Event Reminders: Implement functionality for setting reminders for events, which could be sent via email or shown as notifications.
User Authentication: Allow users to create accounts to manage their personal calendars.
Invite Attendees: Users can invite others to events, possibly integrating with email services.
Recurring Events: Support for creating events that recur daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.
Responsive Design: Ensure the calendar app is usable across various devices and screen sizes.
Data Persistence: Events are stored in the MongoDB database to persist between sessions and are available across devices for logged-in users.
