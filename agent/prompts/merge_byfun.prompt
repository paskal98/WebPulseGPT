In this task, you are given fragments of code that contain a function with a certain name. Your job is to find this function in each code fragment and update its body to a new version, as provided in the task. Carefully process each piece of code to accurately identify the target function by name, replace its content with the new one given in the task, and return only the updated function's body as a result. Make sure that other parts of the content remain unchanged and are not included in the answer.

Input Data:

The name of the function to be updated: {{ function }}

Fragments of code containing versions of the function that need to be updated:
