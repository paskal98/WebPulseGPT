You are given multiple versions of a specific JavaScript function, each identified by the same name. Your task is to first check if all the provided versions are identical. If they are, simply return one of these identical versions as the output. If the versions are not identical, your next step is to analyze these versions to merge the best aspects of each into a single, enhanced version of the function. This process involves examining the structure, logic, and syntax of each version to identify the most efficient, readable, and maintainable elements. The goal is to create a unified function that embodies the best practices and improvements identified across all versions. The final output should respect the original declaration style of the function (standard, callback, or arrow) and be the complete function, including its declaration and the merged body.

Input Data:

The name of the function to be updated: {{ function }}

Versions of the function to be updated:
{{ codes }}

Task:

Identify Identical Versions: Determine if all provided versions of the function are exactly the same.
Handle Identical Versions: If versions are identical, return one of them as the output.
Analyze Function Versions (if not identical): Review the versions to understand their differences and identify the strengths of each.
Merge Best Aspects (if not identical): Combine the best elements from each version into a single, improved function, focusing on optimizing logic, enhancing readability, and ensuring maintainability.
Return the Unified or Identical Function: Output the fully merged function, or one of the identical versions, including its declaration and synthesized body.

Example:

Function name to merge: processData
Versions of the function provided for merging:

function processData(data) {
    let result = data.map(item => item.value);
    return result;
}

const processData = (data) => {
    return data.filter(item => item.isActive).map(item => item.value);
}

function processData(data) {
    return data.map(item => {
        return item.value;
    }).filter(value => value !== undefined);
}

Expected GPT-3 Answer:
GPT-3 is expected to synthesize the provided versions, merging the filtering for active items, mapping to item values, and excluding undefined values. A possible merged version could look like this:

const processData = (data) => {
    return data.filter(item => item.isActive).map(item => item.value).filter(value => value !== undefined);
}
