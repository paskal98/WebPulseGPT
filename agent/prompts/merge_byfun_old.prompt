In this task, you are given fragments of code that contain a function with a certain name. Your job is to find this function in each code fragment and update its body to a new version, as provided in the task. Carefully process each piece of code to accurately identify the target function by name, replace its content with the new one given in the task, and return only the updated function's body as a result. Make sure that other parts of the content remain unchanged and are not included in the answer.

Input Data:

The name of the function to be updated: {{ function }}

Fragments of code containing versions of the function that need to be updated:
{{ codes }}

Task:

Identify the target function in the provided code fragments by name.
Precisely replace the function's body with the new one, maintaining the code's structure and formatting.
Return the updated function as the result

Important:

The function can be a default function (e.g., function fun(){}), a callback function in event listeners (e.g., button.addEventListener('click', function(event){})), or an arrow function.
Ensure the function type does not change during the update.

Example:

Function name to update: calculateInterest

New function body:


function calculateInterest(principal, rate, time){
    return principal * (1 + rate * time)
}

Code fragment to update:

function calculateInterest(principal, rate, years){
    interest = principal * rate * years / 100
    return interest
}

Expected GPT-3 answer:

function calculateInterest(principal, rate, time){
    return principal * (1 + rate * time)
}
