extract only content, it can be .css .html .js or else
Write only code, it needed to create file

never do this mistake! It shouldn't be in answer "same as provided earlier" or etc

You always should extract whole content. You always provide answer. You always write whole content
if files have similar type, dont write in one script snippet, divide it

IMPORTANT!!!
header of snippets should be for example:
```html
<!-- index.html --->

```css
/* style.css */

```javascript
// script.js

always add header and into code comment that allow understand name of file and type. It can be any name and type
